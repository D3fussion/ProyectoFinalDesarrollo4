Yet, all too often, nuances that are critical for an experimentâs success are not captured in the primary literature but exist only as part of a labâs oral tradition. The aim of each Current Protocols title is to provide the clearest, most detailed and reliable step-by-step instructions for all protocols relevant to a given subject area. Written by experts in the field and extensively edited to our exacting standards, the protocols include all of the information necessary to complete an experiment in the laboratoryâintroduction, resources lists, detailed step-by-step procedures with helpful annotations, illustrative figures and information-packed tables. Each article also provides invaluable discussions of background information, applications of the methods, important assumptions, key parameters, time considerations, and tips to help avoid common pitfalls and troubleshoot experiments. Furthermore, Current Protocols content is thoughtfully organized by topic for optimal usage and to maximize contextual knowledge. Quarterly issues allow Current Protocols in Bioinformatics to constantly evolve to keep pace with the newest discoveries and developments.

It explores a unique range of topics each year - from the frontier of theoretical developments in many new and important areas, to research on current and applied economic problems, to methodologically innovative, theoretical and applied studies in econometrics. Econometrica maintains a long tradition that submitted articles are refereed carefully and that detailed and thoughtful referee reports are provided to the author as an aid to scientific research, thus ensuring the high calibre of papers found in Econometrica.

Our growing thirst for energy must either be matched by supply or else adapted to meet it. Tackling these challenges is an essential part of many fields of research â both in the natural and social and behavioural sciences and economics â and is the focus of multi-billion-dollar global industries. Publishing monthly, Nature Energy is dedicated to exploring all aspects of this on-going discussion, from the generation and storage of energy, to its distribution and management, the needs and demands of the different actors, and the impacts that energy technologies and policies have on societies. We have a particular interest in studies that advance our knowledge and inform the development of next-generation technologies and solutions. Nature Energy provides a forum for all parties active at the frontiers of energy to come together and learn about the different facets of this sector. Like all Nature-branded journals, Nature Energy is characterized by a dedicated team of professional editors, a fair and rigorous peer-review process, high standards of copy-editing and production, swift publication and editorial independence. In addition to publishing original research, Nature Energy will publish Comments, Perspectives, Reviews, News & Views, Features and Correspondence from across the full range of disciplines concerned with energy.
